# LaughingTogether\_Children\_fNIRS\_Pipeline

Scripts for analysing fNIRS data



This pipeline processes fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) data from the "Laughing Together Children" study. It converts raw NIRx data, segments interaction and laughter episodes, preprocesses the signals, and calculates inter-brain synchrony measures using Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC).
